# Social Story In Virtual Reality

 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social communication and/or social interaction across multiple contexts. Impairments in social interactions serve as a defining characteristic of individuals with ASD; deficits can range from mild to severe and may manifest as issues with integrated verbal and nonverbal communication, poor eye contact and body language, deficits in understanding and use of gestures, lack of facial expressions, and other nonverbal communication issues. Social stories are a type of prompt or script used to help individuals on the autism spectrum understand and behave appropriately in certain situations. Social stories and other social scripts are based on the idea that some people on the autism spectrum have difficulty understanding and/or behaving appropriately in certain situations, such as meeting other people for the first time. These stories provide descriptions of a particular situation, event or activity, which include specific information about what to expect in that situation and, sometimes, what to do in that situation. Social situations and the accompanying expected set of behaviors are challenging for children with autism, and “play nice” simply doesn’t offer all the information a child needs to respond appropriately. 
 
 The importance of social skill development is critical. Such deficits may impede a child’s development and increase the risk of social withdrawal and isolation. The stories describe and explain the cues in the social contexts as well as provide appropriate responses. Some social stories are written on single sheets of paper, others are written in booklets and some are recorded onto tape or video. The author of the story may read it to the individual with autism, record it so that it can be played back as required, or the individual may read it for himself. If a social story is made in virtual reality, the user is full encompassed into the environment. The individual on the spectrum can become more accustomed to both the physical world of the future event and their expected behaviors. Additionally, virtual reality can create a deeper understanding. Usually in the story, story, descriptive, perspective, and affirmative sentences can be partially written. A partial sentence encourages the person with ASD to complete a given statement in terms of his or her perception of what will happen next or to make a guess regarding the responses of another person. In virtual reality, the child’s perception is matched. The ASD user can have a chance in VR to act out and practice social skills. A child can use the environment to practice a presentation in the actual classroom they will be graded in. The user is also getting more realistic tactile sensations of auditory and visual stimulus. For example, they can go look at the books available, hold the office supplies on the teacher’s desk, and find their name tag for where they will be sitting on the first day. Using the pencil found on the desk with their name tag Component can be used to customize for the user. For this project build it is located at “Rebecca Schecter”), the child can receive praise through a confetti trigger for looking at the bulletin boards within the environment. For example, reading the rules, week in focus, or the homework assignment for the day. Looking at the homework and week in focus will reinforce classroom routines. On another note, the sound of the fire alarm can be jarring to any child in the classroom but can cause and individual on the spectrum to go into meltdown because of their auditory sensitivity. Gaining the opportunity to expose one’s ears to the sound and then prepare for anny modifications suchs as easy access headphones in reality can be prepared. Instead of having to visualize a new situation, the user is experiencing a future reality through a virtual lense. 
 
 A drawback of social stories in virtual reality comes down to the safety of VR for children. This program can further develop to provide time out sessions so that a child is restricted to prevent dizziness or mental fatigue. More research needs to be done to ensure no major damages to the child user in virtual reality.
